# practice-open-source-contribution

## introduction
When I was starting to contribute to the open source projects I was so scared that I would mess something up and no one would ever let me work with them and because of this fear I didn’t start contributing to open source for a couple of years.
Now in order to make sure you won’t have the same fear, I have created a repository for you to practice the process of contribution.
read the guidelines. make your contribution.


## guidelines
the project is created of one file names.txt
inside it you can see a name and a note seperated by "|"

`amir kamizi | I love programming`

you should add your name and a note seperated by "|" in a new line

both name and note are required.

- do not share any personal information in the note.
